# EventFlow: 36 Hours, One AI Agent, Full iOS App

Just vibe coded EventFlow, a conference agenda management app, in 36 hours using Amp. Still waiting on Apple to approve my dev account for App Store publication, but the app is feature-complete and running perfectly.

## What We Built

EventFlow handles the full conference experience: ICS calendar import, smart timezone conversion, event analytics, AI-powered content generators, and Material 3 UI throughout. It extracts speaker data, groups events by day with visual indicators, provides priority management, and includes expandable event cards with full details.

The standout feature? AI generators that analyze your imported event data to create contextual talk proposals and product name suggestions. All processing happens locally—no data leaves your device.

## Why This Matters

Amp isn't autocomplete. When I said "add speaker data from ICS files," it updated the data model, parsing logic, UI components, search functionality, and sorting options across multiple screens. When I mentioned timezone issues, it fixed time display throughout the entire app and ensured consistent local time handling.

The difference is Amp's ability to understand how changes propagate through a codebase and maintain design patterns without constant specification. Traditional AI tools would require extensive manual coordination for this scope of work.

## Thanks

Huge thanks to Steve Yegge, Brady Jeong, Travis Lyons the entire Amp team at Sourcegraph for building something that fundamentally changes how software gets made—and for putting up with all my questions along the way.
