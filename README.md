## 🤖 **The Amp Story**

Built using [Amp](https://ampcode.com), Sourcegraph's AI coding agent. When I said "add speaker data from ICS files," Amp updated the data model, parsing logic, UI components, and search functionality across multiple screens. When I mentioned timezone issues, it fixed time display throughout the entire app.

The key difference is Amp's ability to understand how changes propagate through a codebase and maintain design patterns without constant specification.

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

- **Flutter/Dart** with Material 3 design system
- **Provider pattern** for state management  
- **Service layer** for calendar parsing and data handling
- **Comprehensive testing** with CI/CD pipeline
- **Privacy-first** - all data stays local

## 🧪 **Development**

EventFlow includes enterprise-grade development practices:

- **17+ comprehensive tests** (unit, widget, integration)
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** with automated testing and reporting
- **Agent feedback loops** for automated issue resolution
- **Human-in-the-loop testing** on real devices

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for development guidelines and [agent_assets/backlog.md](agent_assets/backlog.md) for project roadmap.

## 📱 **Status**

**App Store Ready** - Waiting for Apple Developer Account approval for publication. Currently runs perfectly via Xcode deployment with weekly re-installation for free developer accounts.
