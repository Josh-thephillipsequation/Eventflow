WHAT MAKES EVENTFLOW DIFFERENT

Unlike other calendar apps, EventFlow is purpose-built for conferences. We understand that conferences are overwhelming with hundreds of sessions, difficult choices, and constant schedule changes. EventFlow helps you quickly scan the entire schedule, identify must-see talks by topic, build a personal agenda that fits your interests, discover interesting sessions you might have missed, visualize schedule density to plan breaks, and have fun exploring conference data.

THEMES AND CUSTOMIZATION

Choose from three distinct themes: Light Mode for clean and professional looks, Dark Mode that is easy on the eyes, and Neon Dreams 2077 with cyberpunk aesthetic and animated effects.

BUILT BY DEVELOPERS, FOR ATTENDEES

EventFlow was built using Amp AI by thephillipsequation llc. We believe conference tools should be powerful, private, and delightful to use. No subscriptions, no upsells, no compromises.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

### Character Issues Fixed:
- Removed ALL emojis
- Replaced smart quotes with straight quotes
- Replaced em dashes with regular hyphens
- Removed special Unicode characters
- Used only standard ASCII characters

### If You Still Get Errors:
1. Copy text into a plain text editor first (like TextEdit in plain text mode)
2. Then copy from there into App Store Connect
3. This removes any hidden formatting

### Testing the Text:
Before pasting into App Store Connect, you can test by:
1. Open TextEdit
2. Format > Make Plain Text
3. Paste the description there
4. Copy from TextEdit
5. Paste into App Store Connect

This ensures absolutely no special characters sneak through.
