# Agent Handoff Checklist

## 🚀 **For the Next Agent: Mission Critical Priorities**

### **📋 Pre-Flight Check**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Run `./scripts/validate_handoff.sh` - Must show 99%+ confidence before starting
- [ ] Read [`agent_assets/backlog.md`](backlog.md) - Focus on M21-M24 (P0 priorities)
- [ ] Review [`agent_assets/current-status.md`](current-status.md) - Current state and issues
- [ ] Check [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) - Development guidelines and design principles
- [ ] Read [`AGENT_FEEDBACK.md`](../AGENT_FEEDBACK.md) - Current CI test failures to fix

### **🎯 Current Mission: App Store Automation Pipeline**

**Target**: Complete automation from agent changes → App Store publication

**Current Phase**: **M21** - Automated CI Feedback (eliminate manual pasting)

### **⚠️ Immediate Blockers to Resolve**

#### **M21 - Automated CI Feedback Loop**
- **Issue**: Currently requires manual pasting of CI failure logs
- **Solution**: Implement automated GitHub API integration
- **Files**: `scripts/auto_ci_feedback.py`, GitHub Actions webhook setup
- **Success**: Agent can read CI failures automatically without human intervention

#### **M22 - Test Failures (Blocking All Automation)**
- **Issue**: 17+ tests created, ~50% failing, blocking CI pipeline
- **Solution**: Fix EventProvider async issues, widget test timing, UI overflow
- **Files**: `test/unit/event_provider_test.dart`, `test/widget/insights_screen_test.dart`
- **Success**: 100% test pass rate locally and in GitHub Actions

### **🔧 Tools & Systems Ready for Use**

#### **Working Systems**
- ✅ **GitHub Actions**: Enhanced workflow with reporting
- ✅ **VS Code Integration**: Tasks, webhook server, launch configurations
- ✅ **Agent Feedback**: Template and proven workflow
- ✅ **GitHub Pages**: Professional landing page with UX demo

#### **Scripts Available**
- **`./scripts/run_ci_locally.sh`**: Run full CI pipeline locally
- **`python3 scripts/auto_ci_feedback.py`**: Fetch CI failures via GitHub API
- **VS Code Command Palette**: "Start Webhook Server for Amp"

### **📱 App Status**

#### **What's Working Perfectly**
- **5 Professional Tabs**: Import → All Events → My Agenda → Insights → Fun
- **Material 3 Design**: Consistent theming and components throughout
- **Speaker Data**: Extraction from ICS files with display and search
- **Time Handling**: AM/PM format with proper timezone conversion
- **Interactive Features**: Bingo game, topic clouds, AI generators

#### **Deployment Status**
- **iPhone Testing**: App runs perfectly via Xcode deployment
- **Free Dev Account**: Weekly re-installation required (7-day cert expiry)
- **App Store Ready**: Waiting for Apple Developer Account approval

### **🎯 Success Criteria for Handoff**

#### **M21 Complete When**:
- [ ] CI failures automatically update AGENT_FEEDBACK.md
- [ ] No manual intervention required for feedback loop
- [ ] GitHub API integration working with proper authentication
- [ ] Real-time failure notifications functional

#### **M22 Complete When**:
- [ ] All 17+ tests pass consistently
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI shows green ✅
- [ ] Local CI script shows 100% success
- [ ] No test flakiness or timing issues

#### **M23-M24 Ready When**:
- [ ] Stable CI foundation (M21-M22 complete)
- [ ] Apple Developer Account approved
- [ ] Code signing certificates available

## 🚨 **Critical Rules for Next Agent**

1. **NO FEATURE IS COMPLETE UNLESS CI TESTS PASS**
2. **ALWAYS run `./scripts/run_ci_locally.sh` before pushing**
3. **FOCUS on M21-M24 automation pipeline above all else**
4. **READ AGENT_FEEDBACK.md for current test failures to fix**
5. **MAINTAIN the Amp AI development story for marketing**

## 📞 **Context & Background**

EventFlow was built in **36 hours using Amp AI** and demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development. The app is feature-complete and ready for App Store submission, but we need the **automated CI/CD pipeline** to handle continuous deployment and quality assurance.

The **agent feedback loop** has been proven functional - agents can read structured CI failure reports and fix issues systematically. Now we need to **eliminate all manual steps** and create **full automation** from code changes to App Store publication.

**The next agent's job**: Make this pipeline bulletproof and fully automated! 🚀
