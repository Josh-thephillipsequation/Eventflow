## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- All calendar data is stored locally on your device using iOS secure storage (SharedPreferences)
- Your data never leaves your device
- No internet connection is required to use EventFlow
- Data is protected by your device's security features (device passcode, biometric authentication)

### Clear Data

## Children's Privacy

EventFlow works the same everywhere - no data is collected regardless of your location. No data leaves your device.
