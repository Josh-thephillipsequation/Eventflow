## Introduction

EventFlow ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how EventFlow handles your data when you use our mobile application.

## What We Collect

We do not collect personal data on our servers. EventFlow stores only the information you provide locally on your device:

- **Calendar Data**: Events and schedules you import from ICS files
- **App Preferences**: Your settings and customization choices (theme, filters, selected events)

## How We Use Your Information

We use your locally stored information to:
- Display and manage your calendar events
- Remember your preferences and settings
- Provide the core functionality of the app

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage Only
- All calendar data is stored locally on your device using iOS system storage
- Data is protected by your device's security controls (device lock, iOS encryption)
- We do not transmit your calendar data to our servers

### iCloud Backups
If iCloud backups are enabled on your device, Apple may back up app data to your iCloud account. This is controlled by your device settings, not by EventFlow.

### Network Activity
- EventFlow may download ICS calendar files from URLs you provide
- All downloads use secure HTTPS connections
- We only accept HTTPS and webcal:// (converted to HTTPS) URLs for security
- We do not send your data to our servers or third parties

## Data Sharing

We **do not sell, rent, share, or transmit** your personal information. EventFlow:
- Does not use analytics or tracking services
- Does not use crash reporting services  
- Does not share data with third parties
- Does not have user accounts or cloud services

## Your Rights and Choices

### Delete Your Data
All app data is stored locally on your device. To delete your data:
- Uninstall the EventFlow app from your device
- This immediately removes all locally stored calendar data and preferences

### Contact Us

## Children's Privacy

EventFlow is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will delete it immediately.

## International Users

EventFlow processes all data locally on your device. Your data does not leave your device unless you explicitly choose to download a calendar from a URL.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date above and displaying a notice in the app.
