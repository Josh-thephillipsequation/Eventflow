# Agent Feedback Template

This file provides a template for test reports that can be fed back to agents for automated issue resolution.

## How to Use This Template

When tests fail, copy this template to `AGENT_FEEDBACK.md` in the root directory and fill in the details. Agents can then read this file and automatically fix the issues.

- [ ] ICS parsing edge cases
- [ ] Timezone conversion logic

## ðŸŽ¯ Agent Instructions

### Priority Actions Needed
1. **Fix failing tests** in order of priority (widget â†’ unit â†’ integration)
2. **Add missing test coverage** for files below 80%
3. **Update golden files** if UI changes are intentional
4. **Run `flutter test --coverage`** to verify fixes

### Command to Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/widget/event_card_test.dart

# Update golden files (if UI changes are intentional)
flutter test --update-goldens
```

### Expected Output Location
- **Test Results**: `test_reports/test_results.json`
- **Coverage Report**: `coverage/lcov.info`
- **Golden Diffs**: `test/golden_failures/`

## âœ… Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%
- [ ] No golden test failures (or updated with approval)
- [ ] Build succeeds on iOS and Android
- [ ] No new security vulnerabilities introduced
