SUMMARY:Scaling AI Adoption Across 3000+ Developers at Booking.com
DESCRIPTION:When&nbsp\;Booking.com introduced AI coding tools to over 3\,000 developers\, adoption was slower than expected due to organizational as well as technical challenges. With a strategy focused on experimentation\, real business use cases\, and close measurement of impact\, we turned that early experience into a foundation for widespread adoption at scale. Now\, two thirds of our developers use AI tools consistently\, resulting in accelerated time to market\, more time for innovation\, and fast-tracked modernization projects. This talk will share the practical lessons we learned about driving AI adoption as an organizational capability\, not just an individual productivity tool.

SUMMARY:Beyond Individual Productivity: Building AI-Enabled Organizations
DESCRIPTION:AI cannot be confined to the promise of making individual developers slightly faster. It must be harnessed to rewire how entire organizations think\, build\, and deliver. At Liatrio\, we see the true impact of AI emerge only when it is embedded into cross-team workflows\, governance structures\, and delivery platforms that enable scale and sustainability. Treating AI as a personal tool risks creating silos and wasted investment\, while treating it as an organizational enabler unlocks compounding value and measurable outcomes. In this session\, we will share how leading enterprises are integrating AI into their operating models\, designing systems that go beyond productivity gains to drive enterprise-level speed\, resilience\, and innovation. We will explore potential solutions and frameworks that help organizations avoid the traps of transformation theater while building real capability. Most importantly\, we look forward to hearing the real-world challenges and concerns you are facing\, and to working through them together.

SUMMARY:Building Secure AI Agents
DESCRIPTION:AI agents are no longer science projects—they’re joining your workforce. They write code\, answer customers\, and pull sensitive data. But how do you secure a “team member” that isn’t human? In this session\, Steve will show how attackers exploit agent behavior and share practical ways to monitor and contain these new non-human employees. Expect real examples\, not theory\, and leave ready to build AI agents you can actually trust.

SUMMARY:AI Won't Fix Developer Productivity (Unless You Fix Context First)
DESCRIPTION:AI coding tools keep promising productivity\, yet most teams aren't seeing the payoff. The issue isn't code generation\, it's context. Developers waste hours digging through GitHub\, Slack\, Jira\, Confluence\, and countless other systems just to understand why things were built\, what decisions were made\, and how the system evolved. This talk explores context engineering: giving both humans and AI direct access to the decisions\, history\, and discussions already scattered across your tools. I'll show how Unblocked builds this contextual layer automatically so models like Claude and Cursor stop guessing and start understanding. The result is less hallucination\, faster iteration\, fewer interruptions\, and AI that's finally useful in production codebases. If you care about making AI work for real development teams\, this is the foundation you can't ignore.

SUMMARY:Stop Talking & Start Doing - Leading Teams to Action!
DESCRIPTION:Thrivent is a 100+ year old company whose customers have historically valued in-person interactions. Thrivent recognized a shift in how their customers wanted to interact. This resulted in a commitment to expand their digital footprint to offer new digital solutions to their customers.\n\nIn addition to the digital transformation the technology teams were undergoing a product model transformation. This brought with it additional challenges to overcome including outdated processes\, large siloed groups\, and lack of cross team collaboration without a traditional PMO in the center of the work.\n\nWe encountered a business case that was affecting our internal teams as well as our customers. Upon diving in we discovered that there were 9 different teams involved. This meant that accountability and investment were low as no one team owned the entire process. It felt very similar to spinning on a merry go round.\n\nAfter month of meetings and attempts to connect the dot between 9 teams the confusion increased. It became clear the only way to truly solve the issue at hand was to get the ‘whole team’ together. This meant hosting a workshop that cut across team and organizational boundaries.\n\nWe opted to run an immersive GSD workshop using an action-oriented facilitation method. This involved getting people together\, aligning on a common outcome\, and shifting mindsets within the container.\n\n

SUMMARY:The Rise of Agentic Testing: The Old Ways Are No Longer Enough
DESCRIPTION:AI is fundamentally changing software development\, including development pace\, release frequency\, and how to ensure quality. The use of AI continues to increase with greater investment within organizations across industries and is no longer optional. Companies that effectively leverage AI as a path to innovation have a competitive advantage over those that attempt to stick with tried-and-true approaches.\n\nUsing AI for software development alone isn’t enough. Users need software that works\, is free of bugs\, and is high-performing. As organizations increase their use of AI\, they must also invest in AI-powered testing to achieve quality and speed.\n\nDuring this talk\, we will look at agentic testing\, why it is\, how to use it\, and why it is essential. During this session\, you can expect to learn:\n\nWhat is agentic testing and what are its applications?\n\nWhy is agentic testing fundamental to any testing strategy?\n\nHow Agentic Test Automation simplifies and accelerates the testing?\n\nHow a real organization was able to apply these techniques.

SUMMARY:From Agile 2.0 to "Agile 3.0 +AI": Telenet's Unfiltered Journey
DESCRIPTION:From "We've Got This" to "AI Just Changed Everything"&nbsp\;🤖\nTwo years ago at ETLS\, we shared how Telenet eliminated the Business-IT divide and scaled agile across the enterprise. We thought we had transformation all figured out.\nThen AI arrived.\n\nThe reality check: While everyone's chasing AI use cases\, the operating model is what determines whether your AI transformation creates value\, or just expensive chaos.\n\nWhat we learned in the trenches:\nYour OpMo isn't a second-tier concern in the AI transformation—it is the foundationUncertainty isn't a bug\, it's a feature (and that’s why we'll deliberately slow things down)The question isn't "what can we automate?" but "how much human involvement do we want?"Join us at the Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit (September 23-25\, 2025) for an unfiltered look at our "+AI" journey. No sales pitches\, no perfect success stories—just honest insights from a real transformation in progress.\n\nKey takeaway: AI isn't about replacing your operating model. It's about rewiring it for human-AI collaboration.

SUMMARY:Transforming Chaos into Resilience: The Journey of Toyota's Telematics Safety Platform
DESCRIPTION:This talk explores the evolution of a dedicated team within Toyota Connected that built the Telematics Service Platform (TSP)—the backbone of Safety Connect\, providing critical safety services such as Automatic Crash Notification\, SOS Emergency Assistance\, Roadside Support\, and Stolen Vehicle Tracking. Today\, these life-saving features protect over 11 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles worldwide.\n\nBut beyond the engineering feat of developing a robust telematics platform\, success hinged on an often-overlooked aspect: the human factor. A world-class contact center of over 300 safety agents\, embodying Toyota’s Omotenashi (hospitality) philosophy\, plays a pivotal role in delivering empathy\, efficiency\, and care in moments of crisis.\n\nOur journey began in 2016 as a startup-style accelerator within the vast and complex landscape of Toyota\, tasked with the challenge of launching an industry-defining platform by 2019. The early days were marked by rapid iteration\, shifting priorities\, and the complexity of aligning with hundreds of global teams. But transitioning from this fast-moving\, high-energy phase to an enterprise-grade\, highly available\, resilient\, and mission-critical system required a fundamental shift:\n\n• Designed systems from the ground up with DevOps best practices\, focusing on reliability and cost efficiency.\n• Transition a team from a startup mindset to an enterprise-ready operational model.\n• Maintain resilience and quality in high-stakes environments.\n• Apply DevOps and Toyota principles to build autonomous\, effective teams.\n• Drive clarity and alignment using OKRs and strategic planning tools.\n• Integrate AI technologies to enhance engineering processes and contact center operations.\n\nAttendees will walk away with insights into leading high-stakes digital transformations\, managing startup-style chaos within a large enterprise\, and bridging the gap between technology and human impact—lessons applicable to any industry where resilience and reliability aren’t just technical goals\, but life-or-death imperatives.

SUMMARY:Alice in AI-land
DESCRIPTION:Things are getting curiouser and curiouser. While some folks see this AI Wonderland as full of excitement and opportunity\, the reality is that many teams feel like they’re chasing the White Rabbit.\n\nOn one hand\, it’s vibes\, urgency\, and winner-take-all: “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!” says the White Rabbit.\n\nOn the other\, it’s an opportunity for reflection: “Would you tell me\, please\, which way I ought to go from here?” asks Alice. “That depends a good deal on where you want to get to\,” replies the Cheshire Cat.\n\nIn this talk\, I’m going to share my personal product manager’s view of navigating the AI landscape\, along with observations drawn from interacting with engineers\, designers\, and product managers around the world. I can’t claim to have it all figured out\, but I’m excited to share different perspectives on the journey.

SUMMARY:Grappling with the Bitter Lesson
DESCRIPTION:The "bitter lesson" is that at some point\, improvements in AI depend less on human knowledge and experience than we expect. At O'Reilly\, our business is sharing the knowledge of innovators\, so we are at the cutting edge of grappling with the bitter lesson. In this talk\, I share some of the organizational issues that surface when AI seems magically able to do things that challenge business processes and strategic moats based on our unique expertise. I talk through a particular product design case study. It highlights the leaps over past practice that are necessary to take full advantage of AI capabilities\, but also why the speed of adoption is regulated not just by the willingness of our own employees to change\, but by the willingness of our customers.

DESCRIPTION:Coding agents like Claude Code and Sourcegraph Amp are the powerful new AI tools of 2025. But using them requires great skill -- so much that Gene Kim and I wrote a book about it\, called Vibe Coding! Despite their pitfalls\, the future is clear: Using multiple agents in parallel is how engineers will work. What will orchestrating them look like? Current IDEs don't fit the bill. In this talk I'll explore the next big evolution in agentic coding.

SUMMARY:Securing the AI-Powered Future: Identity\, Access\, and Detection in a Post-Human Workforce
DESCRIPTION:As AI systems rapidly approach writing 80-90% of all code at frontier organizations by late 2025\, we face a transformation in cybersecurity that makes previous technological shifts look incremental. This talk will explore how the emergence of autonomous AI agents—which work for hours unsupervised\, maintain persistent memory\, collaborate via traditional channels\, and spawn sub-agents at will—breaks every assumption underlying our current security infrastructure. We'll examine why traditional identity and access management fails when your "employee" can exist in multiple places simultaneously\, why the cybersecurity capability hierarchy is collapsing as AI democratizes sophisticated attacks\, and how the entire security vendor ecosystem faces disruption as AI makes building custom security tools trivial. We'll outline practical frameworks for organizations to navigate this transition: developing new identity primitives for non-human workers to building detection systems that understand intent rather than just actions\, and establishing governance for hybrid human-AI teams. While the challenges are unprecedented\, the same AI capabilities that enable new threats also power revolutionary defenses.

SUMMARY:Making AI Agents Actually Work for You
DESCRIPTION:The word “Agent” is everywhere in tech right now—yet most so-called agents are just old workflows with a new label. In reality\, the underlying technology is far more capable than the way most enterprises use it.\n\nIn this talk\, I’ll share how I’ve been pushing agentic systems to their limits—what actually defines an AI Agent\, where they deliver real value\, and how to make them do work that would be impossible without them. Along the way\, I’ll unpack lessons from building my own agent-powered tools\, including the unconventional workflow that turned one side-project into a surprisingly polished production service.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered what’s hype\, what’s real\, and how to make AI agents deliver measurable results in your world\, this is the session for you.

SUMMARY:Output to Outcome: An Operating Model for the Age of AI
DESCRIPTION:What would happen if AI Agents completed work from your backlog faster than you could plan the next iteration? &nbsp\;How would your organization need to adapt if teams of people and agents could deliver an infinite number of features? &nbsp\;The pace of AI progress means that these questions are no longer theoretical. We are in the midst of a generational shift where software outputs will cease to be the constraint on value delivery. Instead of chasing outputs\, your operating model must relentlessly optimize for outcomes. &nbsp\;\nEvery technological revolution shatters the existing constraints on production. &nbsp\;In the Age of AI\, the cost of outputs will collapse toward zero\, rendering output-focused management obsolete. Once production is not the constraint\, the operating model itself becomes the bottleneck. &nbsp\;Productivity stalls on legacy organizational structures and obsolete processes. To thrive\, your organization must adopt an outcome-oriented operating model.\nIn this presentation\, I will give an overview of my upcoming book\, Output to Outcome. You will learn about the seven shifts needed to implement AI-native organizational structures and product operating models. Once coding is no longer a constraint\, optimizing your operating model becomes essential to harnessing the 10x productivity gains available for delivering business and customer outcomes in the Age of AI.\n\n\n\n

SUMMARY:AI for Managers
DESCRIPTION:Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) are moving from experimental proof-of-concepts to mission-critical capabilities. Yet building and scaling AI safely and reliably remains a challenge for organizations of all sizes. In this session\, senior leaders will gain a clear\, actionable roadmap for adopting modern AI—grounded in DevOps and DevSecOps best practices.\n\nWe begin with an executive-level overview of the NORMAL&nbsp\;stack: a modular blueprint covering cloud-native foundations\, observability\, Augmented Generation (RAG and CAG)\, model management\, agentic workflows\, and LLM orchestration. You’ll learn how to treat AI artifacts just like code—leveraging automated pipelines\, shift-left testing\, and policy-as-code (automated governance) to drive continuous innovation without compromising governance\, risk\, and compliance.\n\nFirst\, we explore Observability & RAG\, which involves unified monitoring that bridges infrastructure metrics with model-level insights—such as data drift\, bias\, and hallucinations—and share best practices for embedding enterprise knowledge into LLM prompts and automatically validating responses. Then\, Agents & Orchestration\, covering how to define\, test\, and deploy multi-step AI “agents” that interact with downstream systems and how to implement an LLM gateway for dynamic model routing\, rate-limiting\, and throughput management.\n\nWe conclude by providing leaders with a brief checklist—covering access controls\, lineage tracking\, audit\, and testing strategies—to help ensure AI efforts remain resilient\, compliant\, and aligned with business goals.\n\n\n

SUMMARY:Bridging the IT/OT divide: Can AI be the quantum leap we need?
DESCRIPTION:Fifteen years into Industry 4.0\, many plants are still living with an IT/OT gap: great tech on paper\, stubborn friction on the shop floor. This talk reframes digitalization from an operator-first perspective and explains\, bluntly\, why progress stalls in operations—safety trumps novelty (“don’t explode”)\, change is expensive\, and scaling stays painfully linear.\n\nWe’ll show how most of today’s “AI in manufacturing” is still bolted onto the side of the stack\, rather than built into the flow of work\, and what that means for value capture.\n\nUsing a clear roadmap - Assistance (now)\, Collaboration (emerging)\, and Autonomy (future) - we map practical steps toward a vision we call the “Virtual Operator” while keeping process safety and reliability non-negotiable.\n\nAttendees leave with a blueprint to align IT\, engineering\, and operations around the physical and digital twins\, and to decide where AI belongs today versus tomorrow.\n\n\n

SUMMARY:GPUs Without the Headache: Scaling AI Infrastructure for Engineering Teams
DESCRIPTION:AI adoption is accelerating\, but the real bottleneck isn’t models—it’s infrastructure. GPUs are scarce\, expensive\, and often underutilized\, leaving engineering leaders balancing innovation with spiraling costs. The challenge: how do you give teams the GPU power they need without creating an infrastructure management nightmare?\n\nIn this talk\, we’ll explore how Kubernetes has evolved into the control plane not just for microservices\, but for AI workloads. We’ll dive into how dynamic autoscaling with Karpenter enables flexible\, on-demand allocation of GPUs across multiple tenants\, ensuring resources are available when workloads spike—and released when they’re not. The result: engineering teams get the performance they need\, while platform teams keep budgets and complexity under control.\n\nWhether you’re leading platform engineering\, data infrastructure\, or AI initiatives\, this session will provide insights from real-world scenarios and valuable guidance on how to best deliver GPUs without the headache—so your teams can focus on building\, not curating bespoke infrastructure.

SUMMARY:Forget Vibe Coding\, Vibe Leadership is the Real Risk
DESCRIPTION:AI-powered coding tools are fundamentally shifting the way developers write software. Junior developers can ship code faster than ever and senior developers are being overwhelmed with code reviews. AI suggestions are delivered with such confidence that even official docs get dismissed. On the surface\, everything seems productive. But dig a little deeper\, and you’ll find fragile codebases\, missed fundamentals\, and tech debt piling up faster than teams can track.\n\nThis isn’t a problem with AI\, it’s a problem with leadership. Too many teams are running on vibe leadership: a false sense of progress without the oversight and accountability to match. If vibe coding is risky\, vibe leadership is catastrophic.\n\nIn this talk\, we’ll explore:\n- How AI tools are changing the dynamics of software development for better and worse\n- Why high-performing teams need comprehension and critical thinking more than ever\n- Leadership pitfalls that can turn AI acceleration into tech debt\n- Practical strategies for engineering leaders to foster responsible AI adoption\, deeper code reviews\, and sustainable development practices\n\nAI isn’t going away. But if we don’t shift from vibe leadership to intentional leadership\, we risk turning today’s speed into tomorrow’s slowdown.

SUMMARY:Navigating and Securing the Agentic Enterprise
DESCRIPTION:A successful AI strategy combines existing capabilities and tailored technology to reimagine your business processes. This requires agent orchestration\, robust security\, and data governance\, which can be challenging in SaaS application environments that are advancing Agentic AI. Security streamlines the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\, protecting enterprises from increasingly sophisticated attacks. Failing to meet evolving cybersecurity requirements can lead to significant business disruption\, financial penalties\, and reputational harm. This session explores the essential steps to ensure that AI Agents have access to the data they need\, don’t have access to data they shouldn’t\, and perform optimally. These considerations extend to development and test environments\, which are often more exposed and used by third-party contractors. The fastest path to success is secure-by-design AI agents\, with security embedded from day zero\, in the early planning phase\, and throughout the DevSecOps lifecycle. These techniques help organizations innovate more efficiently and effectively\, freeing up resources to drive AI innovation and revenue growth.

SUMMARY:Building a Community of Managers to Lead in the Digital Age
DESCRIPTION:Organizations have journeyed from Lean\, Agile\, DevOps\, and are now entering an even more advanced digital arena. Along this journey managers face the challenges of determining how to leverage all these tools and modern ways of working to deliver better outcomes. At the same time\, knowledge workers demand managers who are more empathic and resilient than what traditional leaders have demonstrated in the past. This presentation takes you from the start of our Agile journey and supporting community of practice to where we are today in building a Community of Practice (CoP) designed specifically for managers who are eager to learn and lead in this new digital age. This is our Lead in the Digital CoP.\n\nWe will share how we have applied design thinking practices\, customer journey maps\, and a change management approach to build the foundations of this community. Based on this experience we will walk through a sample roadmap of our actions\, specific implementation practices\, and our current measures to assess and improve. Questions we continue to ask ourselves is\, how to we tie this into our organization’s strategy and internal efforts and how do we help move from awareness to implementation?\n\nWhile many of you are likely familiar with communities of practices\, we will share how we continue to leverage that forum to help prepare managers to Lead in the Digital Age. We are committed to supporting our organization that exhibits the leadership behaviors to lead in the digital age and empowers our people to bigger and greater things.

How do we deal with the rapid pace of change when a technology this new shows up? How do you successfully deliver value to all your constituents at the same time\, without alienating anyone?\n\nFor over 40 years\, the most recognized tools for digital creators have served a user base that includes creative experts who have been happy with the same workflow for decades\, and creatives who rely on consistency for their business. At the same time\, these users include artists who are working on the cutting edge of generative AI.\n\nProgressive Delivery practices empowered teams to listen to the diverse needs of their expansive user base and deliver the right product\, to the right people\, at the right time. Brian and Adam will share the process and tools they use to progressively release features and radically delegate control of the user experience as close to the user as possible.

SUMMARY:National LLMs – Towards Moderate-Size Models That Are Focused on the Local Culture and Language
DESCRIPTION:Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has revolutionized information technologies\, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs)\, which are now the frontier of this revolution. LLMs enable us to boost our systems and way we process data\, however they present also significant challenges\, including legal issues (e.g. authorship law and related one\, especially crucial in EU)\, transparency (we know very little how the instruction train sets looks like in most of the LLM vendors)\, and non-uniform distribution of languages in train sets (most LLMs are mainly trained on English and Chinese texts\, other languages are the minority).&nbsp\;\n\nLarge language models characterize high proficiency in processing and generating multilingual texts. However\, language and culture understanding (including historical events\, traditions\, folklore\, literature\, and pop culture) is a more complex problem\, much harder than simple text analysis. A lack of such knowledge can lead to misinterpretations and subtle\, hard-to-detect errors. There is a need for moderate-sized LLMs focused on local culture and history.\n\nDuring my speech\, I will present how we built local LLMs in Poland that consume mainly organic instructions (human-written ones) and how we boost our models to be focused on regional/national aspects\, such as local history and culture.

SUMMARY:AI in a Sustainable Way
DESCRIPTION:AI is everywhere but so is the drive to build more data centers that drives the need for more power and water to run those data centers. We need a more sustainable solution\, when Deep Seek first announced it hit the industry by storm\, but what it really did was start causing the question can we really do this in a more sustainable way.\n\nThis session will discuss the use of specialized smaller models the ability to train those models in cost effective ways with your own enterprise data without exposing that data externally and the industry trends around specialized chips for inferencing. These smaller models can be more effective while using significantly less energy and water.

SUMMARY:How We Doubled Engineering Productivity at eBay\, but Still Didn't Save the Company
DESCRIPTION:Once a stock market darling and a pioneering hyperscaler in the 1990s and early 2000s\, eBay has been in steady decline since the 2010s. A household name with a flat business\, eBay has been unable to make substantive strides in its market reach or its engineering outcomes in the last 15 years. What happened?\n\nI was a Distinguished Architect at eBay from 2004 to 2011\, and returned as VP of Platform Engineering and Chief Architect from 2020 to 2022. As Chief Architect\, I led the company-wide Velocity initiative\, which has continued to double engineering productivity across the board. By executing the DevOps playbook\, this has been an unqualified success. I spoke about the first two years of this experience at DOES 2022. In the three years since\, teams have improved on all of the DORA software delivery metrics\, and report better collaboration and developer satisfaction. At the same time\, improvements have stagnated\, and teams consistently struggle to reach Elite status or to alter the overall trajectory of the business.\n\nThis talk is an insider’s attempt to make sense of this seeming contradiction between micro-successes and macro-failures\, and attempts to abstract 20 years of participation and observation into a set of actionable lessons for any organization attempting to transform itself.\n\nWe will deep dive into the following:\n* Technology Evolution\, moving over time Innovator to Laggard\, from early adopter to isolated holdout\n* Business Strategy\, encompassing Learned Helplessness\, the Innovator’s Dilemma\, and Centralized Planning\n* Organizational Culture\, epitomizing Westrum’s pathological culture with zero-sum thinking\, empire building\, risk aversion\, and a constitutional inability to acknowledge failures

SUMMARY:Delivering Music and Spoken Word at One of the World’s Largest Tech Companies
DESCRIPTION:In the 2000s\, I was a DJ by night and a technologist by day. I never imagined those two worlds would one day converge. Today\, as Director of Client Experiences Engineering at Amazon Music\, I help deliver music\, podcasts\, and audiobooks to millions of listeners around the globe.\n\nAmazon Music recently celebrated our 10th anniversary\, a milestone that underscores what it means to operate as a music and spoken word company inside one of the world’s largest tech companies. We approach every challenge with the mindset of the world’s largest startup: moving fast\, collaborating closely across Product\, Design\, Finance\, and Legal\, and never losing sight of Amazon’s first leadership principle - Customer Obsession.\nSince Amazon Music is a part of Amazon\, we’re fortunate to be at the center of GenAI innovation. Giving us access to cutting-edge internal tools and the experts behind them just a quick chat message away. The challenge lies not only in harnessing this power\, but in ensuring it delivers measurable value compared to the classic techniques that brought us here.\n\nIn this talk\, I’ll share what it’s like to combine music and spoken word with technology at a global scale. I’ll also explore how the rise of GenAI presents both an extraordinary opportunity and a shared challenge across the industry: finding how to unlock its full value while staying grounded in serving customers first.
